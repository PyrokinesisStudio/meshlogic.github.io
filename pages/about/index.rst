Although still being a carbon based lifeform, I believe the substance that makes intelligent life worth of living is not flesh and blood, but the immense complexity of our neural networks. Thus, it seems to be just a logical step of evolution to transcendence our biological bounds and limitations into purely abstract form, where physical or virtual existence would be just a matter of implementation :)

Since transcending of our minds sounds merely as a dream, we can already enjoy living in various virtual worlds based purely on computer graphics and simplified rules of physics. Grids like **Second Life**, **InWorldz** or **Open Simulator** are perfect examples of such virtual worlds, and of course, they took my attention. I think, the most fascinating aspect of these grids, which makes them more interesting than any usual computer game, is that they allow to upload and build user-created objects and enable people to get creative. Moreover, you can even script functionality of your creations by a dedicated scripting language :)

Because of the plain fact, that creating of 3D graphics is extremely time-consuming task, it seems just reasonable to share and trade creations between users of these grids, so do I and here you can find links to my stores...
