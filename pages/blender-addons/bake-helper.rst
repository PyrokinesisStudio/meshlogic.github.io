Bake Helper 1.0

This is an addon for Blender intended to automate the baking workflow and to save your time by creating, assigning and saving all desired image maps. It enables to bake a separate image for each material. This makes it especially useful for creating content for grids like Second Life.

Bake all marked objects or a single selected object

Works with both Blender Render and Cycles Render

Automatically create and assign image maps for each object and its materials with
name:                                           “ObjectName_MaterialName_BakeType.png”

Enables to merge all object materials into a single image map named:
“ObjectName_BakeType.png”

When baking is finished, BlenderRender-Textured viewport is used to show baked images

Save all baked textures into given folder by a single click

Automatically assign multiple maps (UV Grid, AO, Combined, Full Render) to all objects

Use shortcut to bake (F5) and shortcut to switch viewport engine and shading (F4)
