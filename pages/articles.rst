These articles were created using `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_, a very handy web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It supports many languages including **Python**, which makes it a perfect tool for writing scientific articles.

**Jupyter** files can be shared in the native format (.ipynb) and rendered using web application called `nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_. To publish them on your own website, you would need to convert them to html or pdf first. However, if you are using **Nikola** site generator (like me), things get easier since Nikola can handle native Jupyter files (.ipynb) as source files for your posts and pages.

If you wish to play with my articles and have Jupyter installed on your computer, you can find a source link inside each article to download the native (.ipynb) file.
