These articles were created using `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_, a very handy web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It supports many languages including Python, which makes it the perfect tool for writing scientific articles.

Jupyter notebooks can be shared in native format (.ipynb) using web application called `nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_. To publish them on your own website, you would need to convert them first to html or pdf. However, if you are using **Nikola** site generator (like me), things get easier since Nikola can handle native Jupyter notebooks as source files for your posts and pages.
