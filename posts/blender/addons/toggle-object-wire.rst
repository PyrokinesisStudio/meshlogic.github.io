This addon makes toggling object wire and subsurf modifiers really quick. You can select to toggle all objects in the scene or selected objects only. You can use two dedicated buttons in the InfoÂ panel, Shading section or key shortcuts.



It assigns two new shortcuts:
    - Toggle object wire ``\``
    - Toggle object subsurf modifiers ``shift + \``


Note: The used key ``\`` (which is located between Shift and Z key on English keyboards) is named GRLESS in Blender's keymap.
